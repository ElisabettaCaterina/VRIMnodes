# VRIM nodes #

VRIM nodes are part of the VRIM Project a Virtual Reconstruction Information Management proposal. VRIM nodes are a collection of practical nodes to manage flexible profiles and path for moulding of classical architecture. The package is designed to support the modellig classical architecture elements that have not been dealt with by the Dynamo-team. In particular, two solutions are implemented as recursive functions, which means that solutions can read Input from an Excel File and then create geometries.
